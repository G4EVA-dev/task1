    <h4>What is a Tribute Page?</h4>
<p>A tribute page is basically an overview of someone whom we admire in our life. In this article,
   I will create a tribute webpage of Timothy Berners Lee using HTML and CSS. 
   I will add an image of him at the center (below the title). I will write a few of his achievements and details.
    I will use div and p tags to write the details and img tag for image. 
    Then using CSS, I will align and beautify the design. Thankyou
</p>

<h4>Quotes</h4>
